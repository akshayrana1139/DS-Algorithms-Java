Question: 3.4 Queue via Stacks: Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.


Put elements in stack 1.. 5->4->3->2->1... now 1 should be at top and can be popped easily...
but for queue, 5 should be removed first...
so we pop each item from stack 1 and put it in stack 2.. so the oder reverses there..
