Question: Three in One: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

Thoughts: I didnt quite understand the question, cant we simply divide array in three equal ( unequal dynmaic parts)
if equal parts, what to do if one stack is filled? may be we can look dynamically?

We can infact do dynamic splitting, where we can make circular array for storing stacks.
