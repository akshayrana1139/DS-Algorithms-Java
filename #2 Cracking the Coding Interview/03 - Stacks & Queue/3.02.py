Question: Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min
which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0 ( 1 ) time.


Thoughts: Store a min_variable as soon as you enter elements in the stack, keep track of it every time a new entry is inserted and update the min variable if a smaller value is found.
