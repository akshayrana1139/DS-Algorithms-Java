Question: Sort Stack; Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. 
You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). 
The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and is Empty.

s1 and s2: 
push 5
push 6.. since 6 bigger than, push 6 in s2, pop 5 from s1 and push in s2

Confused :(

Need to come back on this later
