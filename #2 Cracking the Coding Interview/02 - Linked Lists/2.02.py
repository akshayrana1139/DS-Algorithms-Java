Question: 2.2 Return Kth to Last: implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

Thoughts: Just traverse till kth element and then traverse till the end. I'm confused with the question. 
Are supposed to find just 5th to 10th element in 10-node list?

This seems to be a recursive question. I'm gonna skip this one for being a stupid question.
