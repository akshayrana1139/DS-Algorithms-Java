Question: Check Balanced: implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. 
For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

Always ask what do we mean by balanced here? It says we need to make sure that the height of two subtree is same. 

We can come out of the loop as soon as it is not equal...
